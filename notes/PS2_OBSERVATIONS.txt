PS2 OBSERVATIONS:
- chance of enemy preemtptive attack
- enemies and heroes act interchangeably, there are no distinct enemy/hero "turns"
- speed seems to play a part?
- once started, queue keeps going until player interrupts
- there do appear to be distinct "rounds"
  - each round every entity gets a turn
  - order is different each round
  - GUESS: order is based on speed with random tie-breaker
